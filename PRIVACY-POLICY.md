## Permissions details
      Taking pictures and recording videos
This app is allowed to take pictures in order to scan the QR Code of a contact.

      Search accounts on the device
This app is allowed to search for accounts on your device to login into the app with a third-party account instead of a SendIn account to make login easier.

      Send and recieve SMS messages
This app is allowed to send SMS messages to send you a password reset code in case of password loss. It is therefore authorized to read the SMS to automatically retrieve the reset code to avoid you writing it yourself in the application. This feature must be used when the phone is connected to the Internet in order to change the login validation hash in our database.

      Modify or delete the SD card container
This app is allowed to access and modify data on your SD card (or internal memory) because the application uses databases that are stored internally so that you can access your contacts and conversations even offline.

      See the contents of the SD card
This app is allowed to read the contents of your SD card (or your internal memory) in order to access the data that it itself has stored in internal databases.
